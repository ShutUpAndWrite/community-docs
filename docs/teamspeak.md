# [talk.shutupandwrite.net](ts3server://talk.shutupandwrite.net)

**Shut Up & Write**'s voice server is infrequently used, but still a useful tool in the world of writing. You won't find it very useful to lurk here, but you may want to invite someone on to discuss writing, brainstorm, give verbal critique, or just hang out.

## Connecting to TeamSpeak
TeamSpeak is a free application that can be downloaded and installed from [its official website](http://www.teamspeak.com/). Once installed, it is recommended to go through the audio setup and configure **Push-To-Talk**.

Once that's finished, navigate to `Connections > Connect` and set `talk.shutupandwrite.net` as the server address. Alternatively, **[click this link](http://tinyurl.com/writing-ts)** to automatically join the chat once you have TeamSpeak installed.

## Rules
Again, we do our best to keep things casual. Here's a few guidelines to make sure you're not annoying the heck out of everyone else.

* **Use headphones.** Unlike Skype, TeamSpeak has very little in the way of echo cancellation. If our voices are coming out of your speakers, they will go back into your microphone and create a massive, loud, and irritating echo. Please don't do this!
* **Use Push-To-Talk.** This is a good rule of thumb if you're just starting out. Lots of people have background noise that their microphone picks up on (dogs barking, computer fans running, the tortured screams of basement captives). This isn't so bad if you're talking at the same time, but if your background noise is constant and your microphone is always activated, it means your background noise becomes *our* background noise. Nobody wants that.
* **Don't be a creep.** Lurking is as welcome here as it is anywhere else, but if you're away from your computer, please either duck into the AFK channel or mute yourself. Sitting in a chatroom for hours on end with microphone enabled and never once talking is like having someone stare intently at you from across a room.  
If you're not yet comfortable with using your voice on the Internet, being quiet or communicating through text only isn't a big deal. We only ask that you don't lurk in the chat and *never say anything at all ever*. That's weird.

## Bad Fanfic Night
On Wednesdays at 8:30pm EST (5:30pm PST), a bunch of us get together to read some terrible fanfic out loud and generally have a good time.

It's purely meant as a for-fun activity to get people comfortable with using the TeamSpeak. Don't expect serious critique or, on the other extreme, any actual malice against fanfic. SU&W doesn't have anything against fanfiction in general, which is why this is explicitly called *Bad* Fanfic Night. Fanfic happens to be the easiest writing to get ahold of in large quantities, however.

If you've got a suggestion for Bad Fanfic Night, keep an eye on the subreddit for Bad Fanfic Suggestion threads. Be sure to vote for fanfics you'd like to see read!
